    <h1>Project 3: Responsive Design and Analytics</h1>

    <section id="responsive">
      <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
      <p>Responsive design is important because everyone uses different devices, and what looks good on a computer screen might not work well on a smaller phone or tablet. By using media queries in CSS, the layout can change based on the screen size so users can easily view and navigate the page. Visitors should not have to scroll horizontally or zoom in just to read text. A responsive layout keeps information structured in a comfortable way for all screen sizes, which makes the website easier to use and improves the overall experience.</p>

    <section id="analytics">
      <h2>Google Analytics Reports</h2>
      <p>Analytics are important because businesses need to know what users are doing on their websites in order to improve the experience. The Pages report shows which pages are visited most and how long people stay on them, which can help identify useful content and also reveal the bounce rate. The Traffic Acquisition report helps website owners understand how users found the site, like through google, social media, etc, and this tells us if SEO is working. Event tracking is really useful because it measures clicks on buttons and links, including calls to action so that we know if things are working the way we intend. With all of these reports combined, website owners can improve visibility, usability, and even catch problems like users clicking on the wrong things while searching for something else.</p>
