            <h2>Allergen Information</h2>
            <p>
                While care is taken to avoid cross contamination, Blissful Bakes
                regularly uses flour, eggs, dairy, and nuts in many recipes. Please
                inform us of any allergies before placing an order so we can take
                appropriate steps to help you choose safe options.

            <h2>Delivery & Pickup</h2>
            <p>
                Local deliveries are available within 10 miles of Covington, WA. Pickup orders may
                be scheduled with 48 hours notice. Seasonal weather or high demand
                may affect scheduling, but we do our best to meet your preferred date.
            </p>

            <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>
                Orders canceled within 48 hours are fully refundable. Custom cakes
                require additional time so 50% of the deposit (paid for by adding your cake in the cake-builder) will 
                be refunded if cancelled within 48 hours of the scheduled delivery/pickup time.
            </p>
