    <h2>How SEO Works</h2>

<h3>Crawling</h3>
<p>
Search engines send out bots (sometimes called spiders) to find new or updated websites or pages. This is how they discover what’s out there on the web.
</p>

<h3>Indexing</h3>
<p>
Indexing means saving what the search engine found so it can be retrieved later. If a page isn’t indexed, it won’t show up in search results.
</p>

<h3>Ranking</h3>
<p>
Ranking decides which page shows up first based on things like relevance, quality, and trust. For example, if you search “easy cookie recipes,” Google sorts through its saved results and puts the best matches at the top.
</p>


    <h2>Description Meta Tags</h2>
<h3>Why They Matter</h3>
<p>
A description meta tag is a short summary of what a page is about. It appears under the title in search results, helping people decide whether to click.
</p>

<h3>Good vs. Weak Examples</h3>
<p>
A strong description like “Learn 10 quick tips for healthier meals” helps attract clicks. A vague one such as “Food ideas” tells people less and may get skipped.
</p>

    <h2>Relevant Content Links</h2>
<h3>Internal and External Links</h3>
<p>
Good content links are clear and useful. Connect your own pages with internal links, and use trusted external links when they add value.
</p>

<h3>Anchor Text Tips</h3>
<p>
Anchor text should describe where the link leads. Linking “Best beginner yoga stretches” is better than a generic “read more.”
</p>

<h3>Maintaining Links</h3>
<p>
Avoid broken links that send people to dead ends. Keeping your links updated improves both user experience and search engine trust.
