    <h2>How SEO Works</h2>
    <p>
      SEO works by crawling, indexing, and ranking. Crawling is when search engines find new or updated websites or pages. Indexing is saving what they found so it can be pulled up by users. Ranking is when the search engine decides which page shows up first based on things like relevance, quality, and trust. If you search “easy cookie recipes,” Google sorts through everything it has saved and shows the best matches at the top.
    </p>

    <h2>Description Meta Tags</h2>
    <p>
      A description meta tag is just a short summary of what a page is about. Search engines show this under the title in search results. Even though it doesn’t boost ranking directly, it helps people decide whether to click. So, if your site says “Learn 10 quick tips for healthier meals,” someone scanning results might pick yours over a vague one that just says “Food ideas.”
    </p>

    <h2>Relevant Content Links</h2>
    <p>
      Writing good content links means keeping them clear and useful. Ways to do that are to use anchor text that explains where the link goes, connect your own pages together with internal links for users to explore, show links to trusted sources when it adds value, and don't have broken links that send people to dead ends. Linking “Best beginner yoga stretches” to your actual yoga page is way better than a generic “read more.”
